                Every year, OSMI conducts their <a class="link blue href="">Mental Health in Tech survey</a>, aiming to measure attitudes towards mental health in the tech workplace and examine the frequency of mental health disorders among tech workers<sup><a class="link blue" href="#l2">[2]</a></sup>.

                We chose to analyze the 2016 OSMI Mental Health in Tech survey (full dataset available on the <a class="link blue" href="https://osmi.typeform.com/report/Ao6BTw/U76z">OSMI website</a> and <a class="link blue" href="https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-2016">Kaggle</a>, as the survey questions and number of respondents changed between years, and the 2016 survey had the most respondents overall (1,467 participants).
            </p>
            <p class="tl f4 lh-copy">
                Our goal was to answer one question: how comfortable are tech workers talking about mental illness in the workplace?

                First, we limited the responses to those which indicated they weren’t self-employed, since we were interested in learning about mental illness in the context of workplaces where employees had a direct supervisor.

            <p class="lh-copy normal f4">
                Then, for open-ended response fields we either consolidated (in the case of gender, which we separated into male, female, and gender minority groups) or omitted (in the case of questions asking the respondent to describe their reasoning or experience).
            </p>
            <p class="lh-copy normal f4">
                Finally, we separated multi-response categories, such as those picking the respondent’s type of work from a drop-down list, into binary components, where each possible response became either a “yes” or a “no.”

                We chose to use a logistic model to predict whether a person definitely felt comfortable talking about a mental health disorder 
                with their direct supervisors, answering “Yes” on the survey, or possibly did not feel comfortable doing so, answering “Maybe” or 
                “No” on the survey.

            <p class="tl lh-copy">
                The first model we built was fit with the entire 34-variable dataset. While it passed the model utility test, we noticed that many 
                variables had extremely large p-values, and thus did not possess much predictive power. Because of this, we then ran the model through 
                an AIC optimization function on R, weeding out the least helpful predictors one at a time until the model with the lowest AIC was the 
                current model. This removed 23 weak variables from the model, for a total of 11 variables in the smaller model.
            </p>
            <p class="tl lh-copy">
                This new model passed the model utility test. We then performed a nested models test on this model, comparing it to the full model, and 
                found evidence that we could safely remove the weak predictors and use our smaller model for prediction. Finally, to confirm that the model 
                was quality, we ran the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test on it and found that it passed, showing that the model adequately fit.

        <p class="tl lh-copy">
            Now that we had an efficient model that had utility and fit well, we then wanted to test its predictive power. 
            To do this, we first performed an 80/20 split, dividing the dataset into training and testing datasets. 
            We then fit the model using the training data, and then used it to predict whether the tech workers in the dataset were likely to feel 
            comfortable talking about a mental health order with their direct supervisors or not. </p>
        <p class="tl lh-copy">
            We found that this model predicted correctly on the test data with an accuracy of 83.9%. 
            This is significantly larger than a random prediction of 50%, showing that by using this model, 
            one can reliably predict whether a worker feels comfortable talking about a mental health order
            with their direct supervisors or not. In turn, this indicates that the inferences that we can draw 
            from our model have a higher chance of being relevant.
